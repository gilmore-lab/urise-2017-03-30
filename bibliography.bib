	abstract = {The present research investigates neonatal sensitivity to optic flow. Twenty five 3-day-old infants were placed inside a dark room and observed while presented with a 10 s bilateral and backward peripheral optic motion. Seven constant flow velocity conditions were used (2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, 25.0 and 30.0 degrees per second) and were compared to a baseline motionless condition. Sagittal deviation of the head was computer-sampled at 60 Hz frequency with pressure transducers. As indicated by the mean head pressure during optic flow exposure, infants reacted with backward leaning of the head whose magnitude was linearly related to the optic flow velocity. Additionally, isolated head postural responses were identified. The magnitude of these responses was clearly related to the optic flow velocity.},

	abstract = {Motion cues provide a rich source of information about translations of the observer through the environment as well as the movements of objects and surfaces. While the direction of motion can be extracted locally these local measurements are, in general, insufficient for determining object and surface motions. To study the development of local and global motion processing mechanisms, we recorded Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs) in response to dynamic random dot displays that alternated between coherent rotational motion and random motion at 0.8\&\#xa0;Hz. We compared the spatio-temporal tuning of the evoked response in 4–6\&\#xa0;months old infants to that of adults by recording over a range of dot displacements and temporal update rates. Responses recorded at the frequency of the coherent motion modulation were tuned for displacement at the occipital midline in both adults in infants. Responses at lateral electrodes were tuned for speed in adults, but not in infants. Infant responses were maximal at a larger range of spatial displacement than that of adults. In contrast, responses recorded at the dot-update rate showed a more similar parametric displacement tuning and scalp topography in infants and adults. Taken together, our results suggest that while local motion processing is relatively mature at 4–6\&\#xa0;months, global integration mechanisms exhibit significant immaturities at this age.},

	abstract = {Humans discriminate approaching objects from receding ones shortly after birth, and optic flow associated with self-motion may activate distinctive brain networks, including the human MT+ complex. We sought evidence for evoked brain activity that distinguished radial motion from other optic flow patterns, such as translation or rotation by recording steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs), in both adults and 4–6 month-old infants to direction-reversing optic flow patterns. In adults, radial flow evoked distinctive brain responses in both the time and frequency domains. Differences between expansion\&sol;contraction and both translation and rotation were especially strong in lateral channels (PO7 and PO8), and there was an asymmetry between responses to expansion and contraction. In contrast, infants\&apos; evoked response waveforms to all flow types were equivalent, and showed no evidence of the expansion\&sol;contraction asymmetry. Infants\&apos; responses were largest and most reliable for the translation patterns in which all dots moved in the same direction. This pattern of response is consistent with an account in which motion processing systems detecting locally uniform motion develop earlier than do systems specializing in complex, globally non-uniform patterns of motion, and with evidence suggesting that motion processing undergoes prolonged postnatal development.},

	abstract = {The development of spatial vision is relatively well documented in human and nonhuman primates. However, little is known about the development of sensitivity to motion. We measured the development of sensitivity to direction of motion, and the relationship between motion and contrast sensitivity in macaque monkeys as a function of age. Monkeys (Macaca nemestrina, aged between 10 days and 3 years) discriminated direction of motion in random-dot kinematograms. The youngest monkeys showed directionally selective orienting and the ability to integrate motion signals at large dot displacements and fast speeds. With age, coherence sensitivity improved for all spatial and temporal dot displacements tested. The temporal interval between the dots was far less important than the spatial offset in determining the animals' performance at all but the youngest ages. Motion sensitivity improved well beyond the end of the first postnatal year, when mid-spatial-frequency contrast sensitivity reached asymptote, and continued for at least 3 years. Sensitivity to contrast at high spatial frequencies also continued to develop beyond the end of the first year. We conclude that the development of motion sensitivity depends on mechanisms beyond the low-level filters presumed to limit acuity and contrast sensitivity, and most likely reflects the function of extrastriate visual areas.},

	abstract = {Motion provides animals with fast and robust cues for navigation and object detection. In the first case, stereotyped patterns of optic flow inform a moving observer about the direction and speed of its own movement. In the case of object detection, regional differences in motion allow for the segmentation of figures from their background, even in the absence of color or shading cues. Previous research has investigated human electrophysiological responses to global motion across speeds, but only focused upon one type of optic flow pattern. Here, we compared steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) responses across patterns and speeds, both for optic flow and for motion-defined figure patterns, to assess the extent to which the processes are pattern-general or pattern-specific. For optic flow, pattern and speed effects on response amplitudes varied substantially across channels, suggesting pattern-specific processing at slow speeds and pattern-general activity at fast speeds. Responses for coherence- and direction-defined figures were comparatively more uniform, with similar response profiles and spatial distributions. Self- and object-motion patterns activate some of the same circuits, but these data suggest differential sensitivity: not only across the two classes of motion, but also across the patterns within each class, and across speeds. Thus, the results demonstrate that cortical processing of global motion is complex and activates a distributed network.},

INTRODUCTION Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error.
RATIONALE There is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.
RESULTS We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P {\textless} .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.
CONCLUSION No single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here. Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that “we already know this” belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.

Empirically analyzing empirical evidence
One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study.

As a result, the statistics of visual motion infant observers experience differs from adults in some situations [1,2]. We ask whether these differences apply more generally, and if so, what factors account for them. In one analysis, we simulate the effects of changes in body posture, speed of locomotion, and surface geometry on motion statistics. In a second analysis, we empirically measure the statistics of visual motion experienced by observers across the first year of life using infant-perspective videos captured during episodes when infants were moving through space or were stationary. We include samples of infants in from North America and those from India to assess how variations in cultural practices influence infants' visual experiences. We find that fast laminar motion patterns dominate the visual input young infants experience and that cultural differences play a role in shaping visual motion experiences.},

	abstract = {Optic flow informs moving observers about their heading direction. Neurons in monkey medial superior temporal (MST) cortex show heading selective responses to optic flow and planar direction selective responses to patches of local motion. We recorded MST neuronal responses to a 90 × 90° optic flow display and to a 3 × 3 array of local motion patches covering the same area. Our goal was to test the hypothesis that the optic flow responses reflect the sum of the local motion responses. The local motion responses of each neuron were modeled as mixtures of Gaussians, combining the effects of two Gaussian response functions derived using a genetic algorithm, and then used to predict that neuron's optic flow responses. Some neurons showed good correspondence between local motion models and optic flow responses, others showed substantial differences. We used the genetic algorithm to modulate the relative strength of each local motion segment's responses to accommodate interactions between segments that might modulate their relative efficacy during co-activation by global patterns of optic flow. These gain modulated models showed uniformly better fits to the optic flow responses, suggesting that coactivation of receptive field segments alters neuronal response properties. We tested this hypothesis by simultaneously presenting local motion stimuli at two different sites. These two-segment stimuli revealed that interactions between response segments have direction and location specific effects that can account for aspects of optic flow selectivity. We conclude that MST's optic flow selectivity reflects dynamic interactions between spatially distributed local planar motion response mechanisms.},

	abstract = {How does visual experience change over development? To investigate changes in visual input over the developmental transition from crawling to walking, thirty 13-month-olds crawled or walked down a straight path wearing a head-mounted eye tracker that recorded gaze direction and head-centered field of view. Thirteen additional infants wore a motion tracker that recorded head orientation. Compared to walkers, crawlers' field of view contained less walls and more floor. Walkers directed gaze straight ahead at caregivers, whereas crawlers looked down at the floor. Crawlers obtained visual information about targets at higher elevations—caregivers and toys—by craning their heads upward and sitting up to bring the room into view. Findings indicate that visual experiences are intimately tied to infants' posture.},

	abstract = {Structured patterns of global visual motion called optic flow provide crucial information about an observer's speed and direction of self-motion and about the geometry of the environment. Brain and behavioral responses to optic flow undergo considerable postnatal maturation, but relatively little brain imaging evidence describes the time course of development in motion processing systems in early to middle childhood, a time when psychophysical data suggest that there are changes in sensitivity. To fill this gap, electroencephalographic (EEG) responses were recorded in 4- to 8-year-old children who viewed three time-varying optic flow patterns (translation, rotation, and radial expansion/contraction) at three different speeds (2, 4, and 8 deg/s). Modulations of global motion coherence evoked coherent EEG responses at the first harmonic that differed by flow pattern and responses at the third harmonic and dot update rate that varied by speed. Pattern-related responses clustered over right lateral channels while speed-related responses clustered over midline channels. Both children and adults show widespread responses to modulations of motion coherence at the second harmonic that are not selective for pattern or speed. The results suggest that the developing brain segregates the processing of optic flow pattern from speed and that an adult-like pattern of neural responses to optic flow has begun to emerge by early to middle childhood.},
